# Weather App

A simple react app which shows the weather for 5 days and informs when you need an umbrella or a jacket

## Installation

Go to the project folder and run the following command

```bash
npm i 
```

## Usage

```
npm start
```

## Assumptions
- The Temperature used is in Fahrenheit
- We suggest a jacket if Temperature is less than or equal to 45 Fahrenheit
- We suggest an umbrella when the forecast is for rain

## Limitations 
- The daily forecasts API was paid so I used the free API available which provides hourly data and using 1st result from the data set (returns a combination of 8) and considering that for the whole day.
